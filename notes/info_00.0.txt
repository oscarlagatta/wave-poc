Questions:

0.- When a Tagger selects a single sound recording (ISRC) and navigates from Audition into Amplify, the Tagger 
    should be able to view previously applied tags, both those applied by Amplify users and via the IRCAM process within the Amplify tagging UI.
1.- When the user comes from Audition,  in Amplify how do I retreive the previously applied tags? 
    1.1- What is the API details ?
2.- 


Constraints:
1.- When the user selects a sound recording record, only the the tags applied to the selected single sound recording are visible.
2.- It is assumed that the user will not be able to select more than one sound recording at a time to view and/or update tags.


Front-end IRCAM Tag & Manual Tags: 
Parent to be visible and children should be collapsed if keyword not available (Front end dev control needed, Matt to mockup):
Romantic (Parent) > Early Romantic (child is shown), but not Early.

If the user selects too choose any portion of the breadcrumbs within the Taxonomy view, the behaviour would be 
to traverse the user to the selected portion of the breadcrumb in the Taxonomy hierarchy.Â CAN YOU EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE ?


Technical Notes (including logic and exceptions)
*----------------------------------------------*
An IRCAM tag(s) is only displayed/visible to the user if the confidence value from the IRCAM output for the selected sound recording
 is greater than or equal to the threshold set for that item.

 If the threshold value for an item is changed (i.e. an Administrator updates the taxonomy mapping/threshold) and the confidence value
  for that item no longer meets the threshold, the corresponding tag is no longer displayed/visible to the user.

If the confidence value for a tag item changes (e.g. re-training of the IRCAM algorithm results in a different set of outputs
 when the logic is rerun), and it no longer meets the defined threshold, the corresponding Amplify tag is no longer 
 displayed/visible to the user.
